## What is Traffic Simulator?

Traffic Simulator generates a random traffic network based on user-defined parameters, and uses machine-learning methods to optimize traffic lights for better flow.

Simply set your parameters and watch the magic happen ✨.

## 🚀Quick start
This project uses CMake for easy cross-platform builds.

### Clone/Download the repo
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ninja7v/Traffic-Simulator.git
cd Traffic-Simulator
```
### Compile and run
```cmd
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Or even faster in Visual Studio Code: open the project and hit F5.

Once launched, a window pops up with a random traffic network running until you close it.

## 📖Documentation
This code is well commented for [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html).
You can generate a complete documentation set using Doxygen.
